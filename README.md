# PRANDTL-FA

One page instructions to build a flying wing glider using foam core board,
hot glue and packing tape.

All credit for the design of this wing goes to David Z.
who shared the plans in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZ3NEzIZcV0).

I am calling this the PRANDTL-FA for First Approximation of a 
[PRANDTL wing](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/programs_projects/PRANDTL/index.html).
